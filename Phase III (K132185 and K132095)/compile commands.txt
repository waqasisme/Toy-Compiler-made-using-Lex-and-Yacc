flex scanner.l
bison -dv parser.y
gcc lex.yy.c -o output.exe


HOW I GOT RID OF ERRORS:
1. we were using C keywords as tokens (void continue default waghera) so i just capitalized the token names and those errors went away
2. some files were being included twice as a result of which yyerror ki definition ka masla araha tha
3. mingw wala khudi ghayab hogaya on fixing others
4. no need to include parser.tab.c while giving compilation command because lex.yy.c already includes it in start
